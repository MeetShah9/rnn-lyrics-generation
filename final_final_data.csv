 Liner Notes by Taylor Swift, by Taylor Swift,"i was born in reading, pennsylvania on december ,  in the world we live in, much is said about when we are born and when we die our birthday is celebrated every year to commemorate the very instant we came into the world and a funeral is held to mark the day we leave it but lately i've been wondering what can be said of all the moments in between our birth and our death the moments when we are reborn the debate over whether people change is an interesting one for me to observe because it seems like all i ever do is change all i ever do is learn from my mistakes so i don't make the same ones again then i make new ones i know people can change because it happens to me little by little every day every day i wake up as someone slightly new isn't it wild and intriguing and beautiful to think that every day we are new for the last few years, i've woken up every day not wanting, but needing to write a new style of music i needed to change the way i told my stories and the way they sounded i listened to a lot of music from the decade in which i was born and i listened to my intuition that it was a good thing to follow this gut feeling i was also writing a different storyline than i'd ever told you before i wrote about moving to the loudest and brightest city in the world, the city i had always been overwhelmed by until now i think you have to know who you are and what you want in order to take on new york and all its blaring truth i wrote about the thrill i got when i finally learned that love, to some extent, is just a game of cat and mouse i wrote about looking back on a lost love and understanding that nothing good comes without loss and hardship and constant struggle there is no riding off into the sunset, like i used to imagine we are never out of the woods, because we are always going to be fighting for something i wrote about love that comes back to you just when you thought it was lost forever, and how some feelings never go out of style i wrote about an important lesson i learned recently that people can say whatever they want about me, but they can't make me lose my mind i've learned how to shake things off i've told you my stories for years now some have been about coming of age some have been about coming undone this is a story about coming into your own, and as a result coming alive i hope you know that you've given me the courage to change i hope you know that who you are is who you choose to be, and that whispers behind your back don't define you you are the only person who gets to decide what you will be remembered for from the girl who said she would never cut her hair or move to new york or find happiness in a world where she is not in love love, taylor welcome to new york hidden message: we begin our story in new york  blank space hidden message: there once was a girl known by everyone and no one  style hidden message: her heart belonged to someone who couldn’t stay  out of the woods hidden message: they loved each other recklessly  all you had to do was stay hidden message: they paid the price  shake it off hidden message: she danced to forget him  i wish you would hidden message: he drove past her street each night  bad blood hidden message: she made friends and enemies  wildest dreams hidden message: he only saw her in his dreams  how you get the girl hidden message: then one day he came back  this love hidden message: timing is a funny thing  i know places hidden message: and everyone was watching  clean hidden message: she lost him but she found herself and somehow that was everything deluxe  wonderland  you are in love  new romantics  i know places pianovocal voice memo  i wish you would trackvocal voice memo  blank space guitarvocal voice memo",3798,817

Ballad in Plain D by Bob Dylan,Another Side of Bob Dylan by Bob Dylan,"i once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze with the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn i courted her proudly but now she is gone gone as the season she's taken  in a young summer's youth, i stole her away from her mother and sister, though close did they stay each one of them suffering from the failures of their day with strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us  of the two sisters, i loved the young with sensitive instincts, she was the creative one their constant scrapegoat, she was easily undone by the jealousy of others around her  for her parasite sister, i had no respect bound by her boredom, her pride to protect countless visions of the other she'd reflect as a crutch for her scenes and her society  myself, for what i did, i cannot be excused the changes i was going through can't even be used for the lies that i told her in hope not to lose the couldbe dreamlover of my lifetime  with unseen consciousness, i possessed in my grip a magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped noticing not that i'd already slipped to the sin of love's false security  from silhouetted anger to manufactured peace answers of emptiness voice vacancies 'til the tombstones of damage read no questions but please what's wrong, what's exactly the matter  and so it did happen like it could have been foreseen the timeless explosion of fantasy's dream at the peak of the night, the king and the queen tumbled all down into pieces  ""the tragic figure"" her sister did shout ""leave her alone, god damn you, get out"" and i in my armor, turning about and nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness  beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound her sister and i in a screaming battleground and she in between, the victim of sound soon shattered as a child to the shadows all is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight i gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight my mind it was mangled, i ran into the night leaving all of love's ashes behind me  the wind knocks my window, the room it is wet the words to say i'm sorry, i haven't found yet i think of her often and hope whoever she's met will be fully aware of how precious she is  ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me ""how good, how good does it feel to be free"" and i answer them most mysteriously ""are birds free from the chains of the skyway""",2380,498

Chimes of Freedom by Bob Dylan,Another Side of Bob Dylan by Bob Dylan,"far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll we ducked inside the doorways, thunder went crashing as majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds seemin' to be the chimes of freedom flashing flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight and for each and every underdog soldier in the night and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched with faces hidden as the walls were tightening as the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain dissolved into the bells of the lightning tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake tolling for the luckless, they abandoned and forsaked tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail the sky cracked its poems in naked wonder that the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze leavin' only bells of lightning and its thunder striking for the gentle, striking for the kind striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind and the poet and the painter far behind his rightful time and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  and the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales for disrobed faceless forms of no position tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts all down in takenforgranted situations tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute for the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute for the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  even though a cloud's white curtain in a faroff corner flared and the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones condemned to drift or else be kept from driftin' tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail for the lonesomehearted lovers with too personal a tale and for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  starryeyed and laughing as i recall when we were caught trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended as we listened one last time and we watched with one last look spellbound and swallowed 'til the tolling ended tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed for the countless confused, accused, misused, strungout ones and worse and for every hungup person in the whole wide universe and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'",2633,474
